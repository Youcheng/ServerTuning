what is a library?
------------------
collections of reusable software resources

why do we need a library?
------------------------
We want to reuse software that has already been written instead of reinventing the wheel each time. 

how is a library used?
--------------------------
    Libraries may be provided as source files or as precompiled binary files.
    When we want to use a library that is provided as a precompiled binary, 
    we need to perform a step called linking. 
    This is a step to connect compiled chunks of programs to make them work together.
